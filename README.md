# inverse-kinematics_3-wheel-drive
this code is for controlling a 3 wheeled bot with the help of inverse kinematics
components used :-
1) teensy
2) bluetooth module
3) ps4 controller
4) citron motor drivers
5) planetory motors
this code is for all the directions that is front,back,right,left,all the diagonals and rotation
it calculates the speedrequired to run each motor for all the directions through inverse kinematics and powers the motor accordingly
